                    <h2>The Triforce</h2>
                    <p>The Triforce is a sacred relic that plays a central role in the Legend of Zelda series. Comprised of three golden triangles, each representing a different virtue, the Triforce is said to grant the wish of whoever touches it. The three virtues are Power, Wisdom, and Courage, embodied by the characters of Ganon, Zelda, and Link, respectively. The Triforce is often sought after by the series’ antagonists, who seek to use its power for their own nefarious purposes. The Triforce is a symbol of balance and harmony, and its presence in the series underscores the themes of destiny, choice, and the eternal struggle between good and evil.</p>

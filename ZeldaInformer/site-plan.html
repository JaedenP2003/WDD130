      <h3>Games</h3>
        <p>The Legend of Zelda (1986) The first game in the series introduced players to Link, a young hero tasked with rescuing Princess Zelda from the evil sorcerer Ganon. The game’s open-world design was revolutionary for its time, allowing players to explore Hyrule and tackle dungeons in any order they wished. Players collected pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom to defeat Ganon and save Zelda.</p>
        <p>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (1987) A departure from the original’s top-down perspective, this sequel introduced side-scrolling action and RPG elements. Link embarks on a quest to break a curse on Princess Zelda. This game received mixed reviews due to its departure from the formula of the original game, but it still holds a unique place in the series' history.</p>
        <p>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (1991) Returning to the top-down view, A Link to the Past introduced many elements that would become staples in the series, including the dual-world mechanic (the Light and Dark worlds) and the concept of magical items. Link’s mission is to rescue the seven maidens and defeat Ganon, further solidifying the series’ mythos.</p>
        <p>The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening (1993) Originally released on the Game Boy, Link’s Awakening features a unique story set on the island of Koholint, where Link must awaken the Wind Fish to escape. It is one of the first games in the series to experiment with a more self-contained narrative and remains beloved for its charm and quirky characters.</p>
        <p>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998) Widely considered one of the greatest video games ever made, Ocarina of Time was the first 3D Zelda game and introduced the concept of time travel. Link, as both a child and an adult, must stop Ganondorf from obtaining the Triforce and conquering Hyrule. The game’s intricate puzzles, world-building, and revolutionary 3D gameplay set new standards for the gaming industry.</p>
        <p>The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask (2000) Released shortly after Ocarina of Time, Majora’s Mask features a darker tone and a unique time-based mechanic. Link must prevent the moon from colliding with the world by repeating a three-day cycle, making the game feel both urgent and introspective. It is often praised for its emotional depth and experimental gameplay.</p>
        <p>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (2002) Featuring a cel-shaded art style, The Wind Waker divides fans due to its cartoonish visuals but is cherished for its deep exploration and naval combat mechanics. Set in a flooded world, Link embarks on a quest to rescue his sister and defeat the evil Ganon.</p>
        <p>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (2006) Twilight Princess returns to a more realistic art style and features darker themes. Link transforms into a wolf in certain parts of the game, utilizing both human and wolf abilities to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. The game’s darker tone and expansive world received widespread acclaim.</p>
        <p>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (2011) Utilizing motion controls for swordplay, Skyward Sword tells the origin story of Link and Zelda, exploring the creation of the Master Sword. The game received mixed feedback regarding its motion controls but was praised for its innovative gameplay and deep lore.</p>
        <p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017) Breath of the Wild represents a significant departure from traditional Zelda gameplay. It features an open-world design with a focus on exploration, survival, and freedom of choice. Link’s quest to defeat Calamity Ganon is set in a vast, dynamic world with the most expansive and interactive environment in the series.</p>

            <p>Hey everyone! My name is Jaeden Platt, and I am a sophmore at BYU-I! My major is software engineering, and I'm excited to see if web design is the path that I go down! I have been married to my lovely wife since September of last year, and she is everything to me.</p>
            <p>Some of my hobbies are video games, building many Lego sets, and watching tv shows. I also really love to bake and have gotten into baking bread.</p>
            <p>One thing I really like to do is sit and listen to all kinds of music, especially musicals.</p>
